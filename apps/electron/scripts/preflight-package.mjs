/**
 * Refuse to package from a dependency tree electron-builder cannot walk.
 *
 * What happened on 2026-09-22: two installers were built from a git worktree
 * whose `apps/electron/node_modules` is a symlink to the main checkout's. Seen
 * through that link, npm reports `node-gyp-build` — a transitive production
 * dependency of `usb` — as `extraneous`, so electron-builder left it out of the
 * package. Both installers produced an app that shows its splash, fails to load
 * the USB bindings, and dies. Nothing in the build said a word: exit code 0, a
 * signed 255 MB installer, and an app that cannot start.
 *
 * The failure is silent at every stage, which is why it needs a gate rather
 * than a note in a document. Two checks:
 *
 * 1. `node_modules` must be a real directory. A symlinked one means the build
 *    is running somewhere its dependencies were not installed. Junctions count:
 *    `mklink /J`, `mklink /D` and the `'junction'` symlinks npm and pnpm create
 *    all report `isSymbolicLink()`.
 * 2. npm must report nothing `missing` anywhere in the production tree.
 *
 * Two things about that second check are load-bearing, and the first version of
 * this file got both wrong:
 *
 * `--all` is not optional. Without it `npm ls` returns depth 1 only — 53 nodes
 * here against 3,142 with it — and a nested missing or extraneous package
 * produces no problem, no flag, and exit 0. The incident above was caught at
 * depth 1 purely because npm had hoisted `node-gyp-build` to the top; hoisting
 * is npm's choice, not a promise, and a version conflict nests the same package
 * out of sight. The eight `@hidock/*` links are the standing case: their own
 * production dependencies live two levels down and electron-builder packages
 * them.
 *
 * npm's `problems` array is the verdict, not a hand-rolled walk. The walk this
 * replaces deduped by bare package name, so a healthy `lodash` visited first
 * hid an extraneous `lodash` nested elsewhere — npm reported the problem and
 * the walk reported an intact tree.
 *
 * `missing` is the failure, and `extraneous` is not. Measured on the very tree
 * that produced the broken installers: npm reports `usb/node-gyp-build` as
 * missing there — a dependency `usb` requires and the tree cannot resolve,
 * which is precisely what the packaged app then fails to load. The same tree
 * reports over 8,000 packages as extraneous, so extraneous says nothing on its
 * own. And a clean CI install reports two extraneous packages that are
 * harmless: `@emnapi/runtime` and `@img/sharp-wasm32`, sharp's WebAssembly
 * fallback for platforms this app does not ship on. Packaging leaves an
 * unrequired package out, which is correct. So extraneous is printed for the
 * record and never blocks; the first version of this gate blocked CI on it.
 *
 * `invalid` is deliberately ignored. This repo has nine today, all dev-only
 * version mismatches inside the linked packages, and none of them changes what
 * gets packaged.
