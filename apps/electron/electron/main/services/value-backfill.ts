/**
 * Resumable value-classification backfill for the ~1,900 already-transcribed
 * captures (F16/spec-003, Part G). User-triggered from Settings ONLY — this
 * module is NEVER registered in boot-tasks.ts and never runs on Library
 * mount. (F15/F16 rationale: the owner has been burned repeatedly by heavy
 * boot-time work freezing the app on a 1.6 GB / ~1,900-capture real DB; this
 * runner makes up to ~1,900 LLM calls, which must only ever happen because
 * the user explicitly asked for it, chunked and yielded so the renderer never
 * blocks.)
 *
 * Architecture (Codex adversarial review AR-3 — atomic reserve/call/finalize):
 * for each eligible capture, in order:
 *   1. RESERVE (durable, its own transaction) — UPSERT value_backfill_state
 *      to status='in_progress', bump attempts, stamp this run's run_id.
 *      Happens BEFORE the LLM call, so a crash mid-call still leaves a durable
 *      record that this capture was attempted.
 *   2. CALL — classifyCaptureValueRaw(captureId) (load+prompt+LLM+parse, NO
 *      persistence — see value-classification.ts). In-run transient retries
 *      (backoff, 429-shaped errors) happen HERE, entirely in-process, and do
 *      NOT touch the durable `attempts` counter (Codex adversarial review
 *      AR-4 — attempts increments exactly ONCE per durable attempt, at
 *      reserve time).
 *   3. FINALIZE — ONE transaction: the guarded rating UPDATE
 *      (applyCaptureValueClassification, never-downgrade + confidence-floored)
 *      and the value_backfill_state marker (status='classified',
 *      result_rating=...) commit or roll back TOGETHER. A capture is never
 *      left with a rating change but no marker, or a marker but no rating
 *      change, even on a crash between them.
 *   On an unrecoverable CALL failure: FINALIZE-as-failure instead — marks
 *      status='failed' + last_error WITHOUT touching attempts (already
 *      incremented once, at reserve).
 *
 * Recovery: a capture's `value_backfill_state` row is re-eligible on a later
 * run when it is 'failed' with attempts < MAX_DURABLE_ATTEMPTS, OR when it is
 * still 'in_progress' (which — since concurrent runs are impossible, guarded
 * by the module-level `running` flag — can only mean a PRIOR run crashed or
 * was killed before reaching FINALIZE; there is no other writer). Terminal
 * parking = attempts >= MAX_DURABLE_ATTEMPTS, using the SAME counter the
 * eligibility query reads, so "parked items are retried on later runs until
 * the cap" is literally true (AR-4).
 *
 * All marker writes are `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(capture_id) DO UPDATE`
 * (never `INSERT OR REPLACE`, which would silently reset columns the UPDATE
 * doesn't mention — e.g. resetting `attempts` back to a literal on every
 * write, defeating the counter).

 *  - done: classified count. marked: classified AND low-value/garbage.
