/**
 * Boot Scheduler — sequential, idle-yielding runner for heavy, non-critical
 * startup work.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (root cause of the restart freeze)
 *
 * On a large database the app used to fire a *burst* of heavy main-process work
 * right after the window was shown:
 *
 *  - the transcription backlog drain (`startTranscriptionProcessor` → immediate
 *    `processQueue`, ~240 items), plus
 *  - five INDEPENDENT `setTimeout` backfills bunched at 8s/10s/12s/15s/20s:
 *    org-reconciler (which runs the ~1,521-row status self-heal),
 *    meeting-wiki backfill, knowledge-capture backfill, embeddings backfill,
 *    and failed-transcript reanalysis, plus
 *  - the living-graph ingest (rekey over ~43,700 nodes) that the drain triggers.
 *
 * All of that is synchronous sql.js work on the ONE main-process event loop, so
 * it overlapped and starved the renderer's IPC — the window went "not
 * responding" with high CPU for a while after every restart.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Runs registered tasks ONE AT A TIME (concurrency cap = 1). Each task is awaited
 * to completion before the next starts, and an idle gap is inserted BETWEEN tasks
 * so the event loop drains the renderer's queued IPC in the meantime.
 * Provider-backed corpus backfills are not eligible boot tasks: the drain must
 * reach a terminal state rather than merely hiding an open-ended repair pass
 * behind the window.
 *
 * The scheduler does NOT change what any task does or the order the user's data
 * is processed in — it only governs WHEN each boot task starts relative to the
 * others so the UI stays responsive.
 *
 * ## Per-task timing (F15)
 *
 * Sequencing alone was not enough: one task could still monopolize the event loop
 * for tens of seconds and freeze the window on its own. Every task is therefore
 * timed and the record kept in memory (`getBootTaskTimings()`), so a stall can be
 * attributed to a specific task instead of guessed at. The per-task lines are QA
 * logs (gated on the QA Logs toggle, see services/qa-logs.ts), but a task that
 * runs longer than `SLOW_TASK_WARN_MS` always warns — a boot task holding the
 * main process that long is a defect, not debug chatter.
