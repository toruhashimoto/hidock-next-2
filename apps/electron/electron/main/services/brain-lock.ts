/**
 * The brain's lock file: who is answering questions right now, and where.
 *
 * Two processes can serve the brain API — the app when it is open, and the
 * headless `--brain-only` process an agent starts when it is not. The owner's
 * rule is that there are never two, and that the app always wins: the moment
 * the app opens, the headless one has no reason to exist. This file is how
 * they agree. It lives in the profile directory beside config.json, which is
 * the same trust boundary as the database it guards, and it carries the token
 * a client needs, so reading it is the way in.
 *
 * Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-brain-service-design.md
