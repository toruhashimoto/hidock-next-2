/**
 * The questions agents may ask the second brain, and the answers they get.
 *
 * Every function here returns what the matching `window.electronAPI` call
 * returned to the old CDP bridge, so the scripts that read those answers keep
 * working field for field: `hidock_bridge.mjs`, `coverage/ingest.py` (which
 * feeds the board) and the dfx5-interviews skill.
 *
 * And every one of them goes through the app's own eligibility gate, not a copy
 * of it (see capture-read-model.ts and actionable-read-model.ts). That gate is
 * what keeps a recording the owner marked personal, deleted or value-excluded —
 * and everything derived from it — away from assistants. One deliberate
 * difference from the app: `recordings:getForMeeting` does NOT gate, because it
 * serves the owner's own meeting page. Its brain counterpart below does,
 * because an agent is not the owner's management UI.
 *
 * Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-brain-service-design.md
