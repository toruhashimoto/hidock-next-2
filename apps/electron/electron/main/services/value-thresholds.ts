/**
 * Duration gate — the free half of value classification (2026-09-22).
 *
 * A leaf module on purpose: database.ts and value-classification.ts both need
 * these numbers, and value-classification.ts imports database.ts, so anything
 * shared between them has to live below both. Nothing here touches the
 * database, the network, or config; it is arithmetic over a duration, a file
 * size and a word count.
 *
 * Why it exists. The LLM rubric in value-classification.ts judges CONTENT,
 * which is the right call for anything long enough to hold content. It is the
 * wrong tool for a ten-second clip: judging one costs a provider call, and a
 * short clip that never got that call simply stayed `unrated` forever.
 * Measured against the owner's real database on 2026-09-22: of 122 live
 * recordings under 60 seconds, 111 were `unrated` with no quality_source at
 * all and exactly ONE had been rated by the model. He hand-deleted 30+ of the
 * shortest ones himself.
 *
 * Duration decides the bottom end. No transcript is read, no model is called:
 * below these lengths the recording cannot hold lasting knowledge whatever
 * words a transcriber put in it.
 *
 * With one cross-check, because the column it reads is not always a
 * measurement: when the file is too big to hold that many seconds of audio,
 * the duration is understated and the gate refuses to judge at all. See
 * MAX_PLAUSIBLE_BYTES_PER_SECOND.

/** Under 10 seconds => `none` => 'garbage'.
 *  Ten seconds does not fit one complete exchange — a question and its answer
 *  — so there is nothing to retrieve later. This is also where the device's
 *  own accidents land: a mis-pressed record button, a clip cut off at the
 *  start of a session. In the measured DB only 2 recordings sit below 10s
 *  today, because the owner already deleted the rest by hand. */

/** 10 to 30 seconds => `low` => 'low-value'.
 *  A sub-30s clip is a single utterance: a greeting, a "can you hear me?", a
 *  one-line aside. 71 of the measured 122 short recordings fall in the 5-30s
 *  band and the owner calls them worthless. 'low-value' is the reversible
 *  rating (the Library can re-rate, and a user rating always wins), which is
 *  why this band gets it rather than 'garbage'.
 *
 *  30 seconds is where the gate STOPS. The 30-60s band (50 recordings) can
 *  hold a real short voice memo — "the client agreed to the July date" — so
 *  that stays a content judgement for the model, not a stopwatch decision. */

/** Bytes per second above which a file holds more audio than its stored
 *  duration admits, which makes the duration wrong rather than the recording
 *  short.
 *
 *  `recordings.duration_seconds` is not always a measurement.
 *  backfillRecordingDurations falls back to the transcript's last segment end
 *  when the device cache has no duration, and its own comment calls that "a
 *  lower bound". In the owner's DB that fallback is not the exception, it is
 *  the rule: the device cache holds ZERO durations, and 67 of the 70 short
 *  recordings with segment timings have duration_seconds equal to their last
 *  segment end to within a second. A transcription that stopped early
 *  therefore writes a short duration onto a long recording.
 *
 *  File size is the independent witness. Measured over every recording of two
 *  minutes or more, bytes per second maxes out at 60,655 (.wav), 33,968
 *  (.flac), 13,694 (.hda) and 6,172 (.mp3); the dominant device rate is a flat
 *  8,000. 64,000 sits just above the highest of those and eight times the
 *  device rate, so `file_size / 64000 > duration_seconds` means no format this
 *  app has ever produced could fit that file into that many seconds.
 *
 *  The blind spot, stated plainly: at eight times the usual rate this catches
 *  a duration understated by roughly 8x or more. A 60-second recording
 *  truncated to 20 slips through. It catches the shape that actually occurs —
 *  a multi-minute recording truncated to seconds — and it never blocks a
 *  genuinely short clip, because a short clip's file is small.
 *
 *  Since 2026-09-22 backfillRecordingDurations measures the audio itself
 *  (audio-duration.ts) and marks what it measured, so most rows now carry a
 *  real length rather than an estimate. This stays as the net under the rest:
 *  a row whose file could not be read, one written before the measurement ran,
 *  and any future path that stores a duration without opening the file. */

 *  the gate. (Every short candidate in the owner's DB has a file size, so
