/**
 * The app's side of the second brain: while HiDock is open, it answers.
 *
 * The owner's rule: when the app is open it is fully responsible, and a
 * headless brain started earlier by an agent has no reason to keep running.
 * So on start the app asks any running headless brain to step down, waits for
 * it to go, serves the same API itself and writes itself into the lock file —
 * which the headless process also watches, as a second path to the same
 * outcome. A watchdog re-asserts the claim, so a headless process that slipped
 * in during a race, or a lock file someone deleted, is corrected within seconds.
 *
 * The API runs in-process on the app's own database connection and calls the
 * same query functions; there is no HTTP between the app and its data.
