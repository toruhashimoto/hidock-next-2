/**
 * The headless second brain: the app's own code, with no window, reading the
 * database and answering the brain API until nobody asks for a while.
 *
 * Launched as `HiDock Next.exe --brain-only` by an agent's bridge when the app
 * is closed. It is the same binary on purpose. The answers an agent gets pass
 * through the app's eligibility gate — the rule that keeps recordings the owner
 * marked personal, deleted or value-excluded away from assistants — and a
 * second implementation of that rule in a separate service would drift.
 *
 * What it does not do, so it stays light: no window, no GPU, no boot tasks, no
 * embedder, no vector store, no device, no calendar sync, no migrations. The
 * database is opened read-only, so it can run beside the app without either
 * one blocking the other.
 *
 * Its lifetime is the owner's rule, "if the app is not needed, it does not
 * run": it exits after BRAIN_IDLE_MS without a request, and it exits the moment
 * the app takes over, which the app asks for on start and which this process
 * also notices on its own by watching the lock file.
