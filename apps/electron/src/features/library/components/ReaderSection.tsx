/**
 * ReaderSection — one section of the reader's single scrolling column.
 *
 * Three parts, in this order:
 *   1. A sentinel: SENTINEL_H tall with an equal negative bottom margin, so it
 *      covers the section's first SENTINEL_H pixels and adds no height of its
 *      own. Its crossings are what `useStickySectionPins` observes, and its
 *      height is the hysteresis band.
 *   2. The header strip: `position: sticky` at this section's place in the
 *      pinned stack, fixed height, and the ONLY thing that changes appearance
 *      when the section pins.
 *   3. The body, which keeps scrolling under the strip.
 *
 * A `headerless` section (the player) has no labeled strip. Its body carries
 * its own controls, and when the section is minimized or docked the body is a
 * single PINNED_STRIP_H bar that takes the strip's place in the stack: same
 * height, same sticky offset, same pinned look. Expanded, it has nothing short
 * enough to pin and stays in flow; the reader leaves it out of the stack order
 * so the next section inherits slot 0.
 *
 * The wrapper is `display: contents`, which is what makes the stacking work at
 * all. A sticky element cannot leave its containing block, so a header inside a
 * section box pins only while that box is on screen and then leaves with it —
 * measured in the running app on 2026-09-22, four of the five strips sat at
 * -1138, -1106, -863 and -716 pixels while the design called for 0, 32, 64 and
 * 96. With no box of its own, each header's containing block becomes the scroll
 * body and the strips pile up as intended. Every ancestor between here and
 * `reader-scroll-body` has to stay box-less for the same reason, and so does
 * everything between the headerless bar and the scroll body.
 *
 * Pinning deliberately does NOT collapse the body. Collapsing it would delete
 * the height it occupied, the browser would clamp scrollTop, the page would jump
 * up, the sentinel would re-enter view, and the section would unpin — the
 * oscillation that got scroll-driven pinning banned in the first place. Letting
 * the body scroll under a stuck strip gives the same result the user asked for
 * (what remains of the section on screen is its strip) with zero layout change.
 *
