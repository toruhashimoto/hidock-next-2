/**
 * Feature store (renderer) — Track I, Gate 3 & Gate 4.
 *
 * Holds the effective per-feature state, derived from `config.features` through
 * the SAME pure resolver the main process uses. Nav filtering, route guards and
 * embedded-surface checks (GlobalAssistant, TodayCommits, …) all read from here.
 *
 * Source of truth = the config store: `setFromConfig` recomputes on every config
 * change (subscribed below), so a preset switch made through Settings updates the
 * nav and routes instantly. A main-initiated change arrives as a `features:changed`
 * domain event (carrying the authoritative resolved state + any restart-required
 * features for the banner).
