/**
 * Temp-DB tracker for the `main-db` vitest project (main-process, DB-backed
 * tests). setup-db.ts wraps the shim's better-sqlite3 constructor with
 * trackDatabases(), so every handle a test file opens — and the file it
 * points at — is recorded here; sweepTempDbs() runs from a setup-file
 * afterAll, closes whatever is still open, and deletes the tracked DB files.
 *
 * Why this exists: DB-backed test files mint fresh SQLite paths under
 * os.tmpdir() (e.g. `hidock-kg-test-${Date.now()}-${n}.sqlite`) and re-run
 * initializeDatabase() per test. DatabaseEngine.initialize() does NOT close
 * the previously-open handle, and no suite ever deleted the minted files —
 * one full run stranded ~90 files, and %TEMP% accumulated 8000+ of them over
 * time. Tracking at the constructor is the one choke point that covers every
 * DB-backed suite (and future ones) without per-file cleanup code.
 *
 * Ordering constraint: handles MUST be closed before deleting. better-sqlite3
 * holds a native file handle, and on Windows rmSync on an open DB fails with
 * EPERM — which is also why closing only the engine's current handle would
 * not be enough (the stranded ones would keep their files locked).
 *
 * Safety: only files that resolve inside os.tmpdir() are deleted. Anything
 * else (repo-relative fixtures, ':memory:', anonymous DBs) is closed but
 * never touched on disk.
