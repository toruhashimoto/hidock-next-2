/**
 * D3: better-sqlite3 dual-ABI shim — SCOPED setup, loaded ONLY by the
 * `main-db` vitest project (see vitest.config.ts `test.projects`), i.e. the
 * DB-backed main-process test files. Renderer tests and the unmocked
 * `native-binding` project never see this mock, so a binding-load-failure
 * test can exist (better-sqlite3-binding.smoke.test.ts) and a broken/missing
 * production binary is NOT hidden from the whole suite.
 *
 * Why the shim exists: apps/electron/node_modules/better-sqlite3 is compiled
 * for Electron's ABI (NODE_MODULE_VERSION 140); Node-based vitest runs under a
 * different ABI (147) and can't load it — which broke every DB-backed test
 * file. Native modules are externalized, so a vite `alias` cannot redirect
 * them. The @hidock/database workspace installs its own better-sqlite3 built
 * for the Node ABI; this module mock redirects the import to that copy for
 * tests ONLY. DB tests keep running against REAL SQLite (no behavior change,
 * no stubs), while the Electron-built binding the running app depends on is
 * left completely untouched — no `npm rebuild`, no node_modules mutation.
 *
 * Version skew between the two copies is guarded by the version-pin test in
 * better-sqlite3-binding.smoke.test.ts.
 *
 * The shim also wraps the constructor with trackDatabases() and sweeps in an
 * afterAll: DB-backed suites mint fresh temp SQLite files per test and never
 * deleted them (8000+ hidock-*-test-*.sqlite files piled up in %TEMP%), so
 * every handle is tracked and its tmpdir()-hosted files are removed once the
 * test file is done — see temp-db-tracker.ts.
