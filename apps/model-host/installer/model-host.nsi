; HiDock Model Host installer.
;
; Per-user by default: no elevation, no service, nothing machine-wide. The host
; runs as the signed-in person and holds a GPU only while they say so.
;
; It installs the program and leaves the heavy parts to first run, because a
; CUDA build of torch is 2.5 GB and downloading it inside a setup wizard with no
; way to pause is worse than asking for it once the person can see progress.
